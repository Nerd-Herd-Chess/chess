# NERD-HERD-CHESS/CHESS WEB APPLICATION

The Nerd-herd-chess/chess is a chess game Ruby on Rails application, an Agile Team Project developed under the guidance of Tyler Porter and George Heeres, software engineer and software developer. It is still a work in progress


## Tools used during the Application Development include

Ruby on Rails. Ruby version 2.5.3 and rails version 5.2.3

Sublime Text Editor

PuTTY

jQuery

rspec and FactoryBot

HTML and CSS

Git 

GitHub

Heroku


## Creating and Running the application

Set up the initial project structure by creating a new rails web application that uses Postgresql and create an initial, empty database by running rake db:create to have a place to store information. Start the server. Construct the web development pipeline: git, github and heroku. This will save and run the application code in the development and production environment. 

Set up models and database, build the infrastructure which includes controllers, routes tables and view files. Apply user authentication by setting up the devise gem and adding login links to the navbar. This grants users ability to sign up, sign in and sign out of the application. 

FactoryBot and rspec features are implemented using TDD (Test Driven Development) in the Rails app to set up a standard testing environment for the application. The tests are a way to verify that the code indeed performs as expected without having to refresh the application page. The tests ensure that errors that would potentially cause the application to malfunction are detected and rendered in the terminal window. FactoryBot contains a template of the dummy data we want to quickly be able to add to our database and is not usable on production (Heroku).  

Style the pages using HTML and CSS.

Save the code by pushing it to GitHub and showcase the application in production by pushing it Heroku.
